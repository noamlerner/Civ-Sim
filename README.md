#Civ Sim
I've realized this is better described by the term religion.
This simulates a number of religions interacting in a world, and finds which traits belong to the civilization that
lasted the longest.

Traits included are:
		Faith
		Same Kill
		Other Affinity Decay
		Same Marry
		Fight Ability
		Same Leave Alone
		Other Kill
		Other Convert
		Other Hate Growth
		Other Marry
		Other Leave Alone
